Heuristic approach for low light image enhancement using deep learning

# Training 

Model is trained using CNN Unet Architecture on [**See In The Dark Dataset**](http://cchen156.web.engr.illinois.edu/SID.html). Original training code is modified to run on a machine with lesser RAM(i.e Google Colab's 25gb GPU).

# Testing

Model is tested and evaluated with around 97% accuracy. The output is evaluated using python's **Flask application**.
