Heuristic approach for low light image enhancement using deep learning

# Training 

Model is trained using CNN Unet Architecture on [**See In The Dark Dataset**](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark). Original training code is modified to run on a machine with lesser RAM(i.e Google Colab's 25gb GPU).

# Testing

Model is tested and evaluated with around 97% accuracy. The output is evaluated using python's **Flask application**.
